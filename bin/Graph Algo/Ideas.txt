1. Dynamic Components
2. Database to manage user info and stats to use for processing with queries
3. Build your own query system

<Dynamic Components>

~	We could maybe a cipher unlock game where we create elements on a panel at random positions
	the aim of it would be to have an average click time beneath the required threshold to pass a level.
	We could dynamically create and destroy the game form and pass all required information.
	
~	When implementing a leaderboard system to display stats from users in the database. We can then
	create some panel element for each record in the database.
	
~	We could also play around and remove instances of element.hide and replace it with some dynamic implementation.

<Database>

~ 	We can store user stats such as -> 
		Number of decryptions. 
		Fastest Run on a cipher unlock.
		Most times logged on.
		Longest encryption sent
		
~ 	This will be implemented in a Leaderboard where we implement a query builder based on certain
	settings and toggles to query the db.
